The difference lies in how `removeIf` interacts with the iterators of `List` and `Set`.  `MutableList`'s iterator is fail-fast, meaning that removing an element during iteration will not interfere with subsequent iterations. `MutableSet`, however, behaves differently; removing an element can invalidate the iterator and may lead to unexpected element skipping.

To achieve consistent behavior and to avoid potential issues with `MutableSet`, it's recommended to create a copy of the set and iterate over the copy for removal operations.  See the `bugSolution.kt` file for an example of this improved approach.
fun main() {
    val set = mutableSetOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val setCopy = set.toMutableSet()
    setCopy.removeIf { it > 2 }
    println(setCopy) // Output: [1, 2]
    println(set)      //Output: [1,2,3,4,5] 
}
