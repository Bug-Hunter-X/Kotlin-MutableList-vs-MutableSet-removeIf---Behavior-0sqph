This repository showcases a subtle but important difference in the behavior of the `removeIf` function when used with `MutableList` and `MutableSet` in Kotlin.  The example demonstrates that while both data structures appear to remove elements that satisfy a given condition, the internal mechanisms differ leading to potentially unexpected results.  The solution offers clarity and suggests ways to avoid such confusion.
